# Greeting Card Project — CSS Pseudo-Class & Pseudo-Element Exploration

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of CSS pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements through a responsive and interactive birthday greeting card. It was developed as part of my ongoing practice in front-end development, with a focus on enhancing user experience using pure CSS.

## Objectives
- Apply and understand the behavior of common pseudo-classes (`:hover`, `:active`, `:focus`, `:visited`, `:target`)
- Utilize pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for decorative and semantic enhancements
- Implement smooth transitions and basic transformations for interactive feedback
- Structure a clean, semantic HTML layout styled with modular CSS

## Key Features

### Pseudo-Elements
- `::before` and `::after` used to add celebratory emojis around the heading without modifying HTML content

### Pseudo-Classes
| Selector        | Functionality |
|----------------|----------------|
| `:hover`        | Highlights elements on mouse hover |
| `:active`       | Indicates active state during click |
| `:focus`        | Displays outline for accessibility |
| `:visited`      | Changes link color after navigation |
| `:target`       | Reveals hidden sections based on anchor link targeting |

### Transitions & Effects
- `transform: scale(1.1)` on hover for card enlargement
- `transform: skewX(10deg)` on section hover for dynamic motion
- Smooth background color transitions for interactive feedback

## Technical Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure using `div`, `section`, and anchor elements
- **CSS3**: Styling with emphasis on pseudo-selectors, transitions, and layout responsiveness

## Learning Outcomes
This project reinforced my understanding of how CSS pseudo-selectors can be used to create rich, interactive experiences without relying on JavaScript. It also helped me practice clean layout structuring and modular styling techniques.
