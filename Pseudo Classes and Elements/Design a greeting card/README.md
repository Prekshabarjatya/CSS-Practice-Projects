# ðŸŽ¨ Greeting Card Project â€” CSS Pseudo-Class & Pseudo-Element Practice

## âœ¨ Overview
This project is a playful and interactive **Birthday Greeting Card** built with HTML and CSS. It helped me explore and apply various **pseudo-classes** and **pseudo-elements** to enhance user experience and visual design.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned

### ðŸ”¹ Pseudo-Elements
- `h1::before` and `h1::after` add celebratory emojis around the heading.
- Injected decorative content without modifying HTML structure.

### ðŸ”¹ Pseudo-Classes
| Pseudo-Class       | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| `:hover`           | Adds interactivity when hovering over elements. |
| `:active`          | Highlights links during click. |
| `:focus`           | Shows outline for accessibility when focused. |
| `:visited`         | Changes link color after it's been clicked. |
| `:target`          | Reveals hidden sections when anchor links are clicked. |

### ðŸ”¹ Transitions & Effects
- Smooth transitions for hover and background color changes.
- `transform: scale(1.1)` and `skewX(10deg)` add dynamic motion.

## ðŸ§ª Features Demonstrated
- Responsive layout with centered `.card` and flexbox-based `.card-links`.
- Interactive links that trigger hidden sections (`#send`, `#share`) using `:target`.
- Visually engaging hover effects and glowing outlines for focused elements.

## ðŸ§© Code Structure
- **HTML**: Semantic structure with `div`, `section`, and anchor tags.
- **CSS**: Modular styling with emphasis on pseudo-classes/elements and transitions.

## ðŸ’¡ Reflections
This project helped me understand how **CSS alone** can create rich interactivity and visual feedback. Pseudo-classes and elements are powerful tools for enhancing UX without JavaScript.
