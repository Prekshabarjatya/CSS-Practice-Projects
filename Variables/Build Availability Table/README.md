# Availability Table

A simple CSS and HTML project that builds a color-coded availability table. Each cell represents how many people are available at a given time, with color variations handled entirely through CSS variables.

## Files
- `index.html` – Table structure and legend
- `styles.css` – Variable setup, gradients, and border styling

## Features
- Uses six CSS color variables (`--color0` to `--color5`) for availability levels  
- Alternates solid and dashed borders via `--solid-border` and `--dashed-border`  
- Includes a legend with a hard-stop gradient showing the color scale  
- Fully responsive and test-friendly for CSS practice environments

## Purpose
Practice working with CSS variables, gradients, and table styling logic.
