# City Skyline

A simple CSS practice project that builds a city skyline using only HTML and CSS. It explores the use of CSS variables to control building and window colors, along with gradients for depth and lighting.

## Files
- `index.html` – Structure of the skyline  
- `styles.css` – Styling and variable setup

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in your browser to view the skyline. Resize the window to see the responsive color change.

## Purpose
Practice using CSS variables and gradients in a creative layout.
