# README: CSS Good Practices Learned from the Cafe Menu Project

This project was a simple cafe menu built with basic HTML elements and mostly styled using CSS.

---

## HTML Structure (Brief)

- Used semantic tags (`<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`) for organization.
- Assigned classes for easier CSS targeting.

---

## CSS Good Practices Applied

### 1. Layout Organization  
- Centered main content with `margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;`.
- Used `max-width` for readable line lengths on all screens.

### 2. Consistent Typography  
- Set heading and body fonts for readable hierarchy.
- Applied appropriate font sizes and alignment for clarity.

### 3. Using Inline-Block Carefully  
- Laid out item descriptions and prices side by side.
- Set widths (`75%` and `25%`) for a neat menu grid.
- Managed whitespace to avoid unintended gaps between `inline-block` elements.

### 4. Background and Color Use  
- Used a tasteful background image.
- Applied background color (`burlywood`) to the menu for contrast and readability.
- Kept color palette minimal and neutral for accessibility.

### 5. Component-Based Classes  
- Used reusable classes (`.item`, `.flavor`, `.dessert`, `.price`) for maintainable and scalable CSS.

### 6. Minimal Hover Effects  
- Added color change on link hoverâ€”subtle and user-friendly.

## Summary

- Organize CSS selectors and keep classes reusable.
- Prefer semantic HTML and simple, readable font choices.
- Use layout properties like `max-width` and `inline-block` for flexible design.
- Keep colors and effects minimal for clarity and easy reading.
