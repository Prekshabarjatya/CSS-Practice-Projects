# Pet Rock Festival Flyer â€“ CSS Units Practice

A simple event flyer project for learning absolute and relative CSS units. This page displays details for a fictional "Pet Rock Festival" with flexible layouts using units like `%`, `vw`, and `px`.

## Project Highlights

- Demonstrates usage of **relative units** (`%`, `vw`) for responsive widths and spacing.
- Uses **absolute units** (`px`) for padding and margins.
- Layout built with Flexbox for horizontal sections.
- Clean, minimal styling for easy CSS experimentation.
