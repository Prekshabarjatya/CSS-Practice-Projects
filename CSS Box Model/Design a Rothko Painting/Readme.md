# CSS Box Model Practice – Rothko Style

This project is a focused CSS exercise exploring the box model, layering, and blur effects—Rothko-inspired and fully built with modern CSS.

## What’s Inside

- Artboard built using only CSS (no images, no JS)
- A framed canvas with stacked, softly blurred color blocks
- Teaches margins, padding, border, box-shadow, border-radius, and CSS filters

## Usage

- Clone/download the repo
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Edit `styles.css` to experiment with box model props and visual tweaks
