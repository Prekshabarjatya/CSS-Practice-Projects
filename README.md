# 🎨 CSS Practice Projects

This repository is a collection of practice projects from my CSS learning journey.  

- **Workshops** → guided, hands-on tutorials that walk through building a project step by step.  
- **Labs** → independent builds where I apply concepts on my own without step-by-step guidance.  

Together, these projects explore CSS fundamentals and advanced concepts — from basic styling to layouts, responsive design, and animations.  

The repo serves two purposes:  
1. **Practice & Mastery** — applying CSS concepts through structured exercises.  
2. **Reference & Portfolio** — showcasing my progress and work as I build my CSS foundation.
